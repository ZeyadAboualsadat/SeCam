The mobile app receives a real-time web stream and displays this stream on the "Camera View Page." It also pushes notifications from Firebase on the "Notification View Page." The main purpose of this mobile app is to ensure that workers are committed to workplace safety PBEs, and managers can save their precious time by using the app to see what the cameras see and receive notifications whenever a problem occurs.
